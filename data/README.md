Datasets for perceptual and value experiments are presented here:

1. DataFoodFramingNotebook (value) and DataPerceptualFramingNotebook (perceptual): 
Contains relevant measures along each trial in all the participants. Measure of familiarity and BDM confidence were not used in our current analysis.

2. Fixations_FFA_Collapsed (value) and Fixations_PFA_Collapsed (perceptual)
Contains sequence of fixations made within each trial for all the participants.

3. GLAMDataFF... (value) and GLAMDataPF... (perceptual)
Contains relevant measures for computational modelling toolbox (GLAM) for each trial, all participants. Datasets are divided according to the frames (value: like/dislike; perceptual: more\less dots). Datasets with ..._Inv_... in their names correspond to the data from dislike and less(fewest) frames with values/dotnumbers accoriding to the frame ("inverted" or opposite of value/dots numbers. Please check the Methods section of our paper for more details. 

Labels names for each dataframe are presented in DatasetsLabels.xlsx   

** In the perceptual experiment scripts More/Less has been used to name some files and variables. These are equivalent to the labels Most/Fewest used to indicate the frames, respectively.
