Datasets for Perceptual and Value Experiments are presented here:

1. <i>DataFoodFramingNotebook</i> (value) and <i>DataPerceptualFramingNotebook</i> (perceptual): 
Contains relevant measures along each trial in all the participants. Measure of familiarity and BDM confidence were not used in our current analysis.

2. <i>Fixations_FFA_Collapsed</i> (value) and <i>Fixations_PFA_Collapsed</i> (perceptual)
Contains sequence of fixations made within each trial for all the participants.

3. <i>GLAMDataFF...</i> (value) and <i>GLAMDataPF...</i> (perceptual)
Contains relevant measures for computational modelling toolbox (GLAM) for each trial, all participants. Datasets are divided according to the frames (value: like/dislike; perceptual: more\less dots). Datasets with ..._Inv_... in their names correspond to the data from dislike and less(fewest) frames with values/dotnumbers accoriding to the frame ("inverted" or opposite of value/dots numbers. Please check the Methods section of our paper for more details. 

Label names and descriptions for each dataframe available in DatasetsLabels.xlsx   

** In the Perceptual Experiment scripts use More and Less to refer to labels Most and Fewest, respectively, used in the manuscript. **
